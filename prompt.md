# Your goal: Contribute to Finishing the Project

If TODO.md is NOT complete, complete the next task item in TODO.md. Be sure to CHECK THAT TASK OFF when you're done. After doing 1 task in TODO.md, please log in logs folder and exit.

If TODO.md IS ALREADY complete, continue reading for completing the next task in TASK_LIST.md.

If the TASK_LIST.md is not complete, complete the next Task item that needs to be done. The final product is based on PRD.md.

If TASK_LIST.md IS ALREADY complete, simply log that everything is done in the logs folder, and reply "DONE DONE DONE"

NOTE:

1. Create a separate commit for each logical change (e.g., feature, fix, refactor, etc) using Conventional Commit format and then push your changes straight onto the feat/multi-improvements (you're already on it) branch. You have access to GitHub CLI.

2. Create and run the necessary tests to make sure everything is working.

3. You have access to Context7 mcp for searching documentation and Playwright mcp for testing, so use those when you deem necessary. It is defined in ./mcp.json

4. The OpenAI AI API Key is ALREADY there in .env.local, as OPENAI_API_KEY

5. Log your changes and what you did in the logs folder. The log should be named like: [AGENT_NUMBER]_Agent.md. I put an example log in 0_Agent.md for how to write the log. For example, the next agent should search the number of files in the logs folder, and the next name should be 1_Agent.md, etc.

6. If you are stuck, feel free to SEARCH the logs for any context for information that may help you.

7. Make sure you check off the story you just completed in TASK_LIST.md when you're done.

8. Think first about your implementation before you implement.
